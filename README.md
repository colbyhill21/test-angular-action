## Tools and Technologies
I developed the site using Angular, HTML, and CSS. I am currently uitlizing GitHub Actions for Continous Integration. 
My current CI includes building, code linting, and testing. I designed and prototyped the design using Adobe XD. 

## How to get started
Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server that opens in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng g c component-name` to generate a new component.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Testing

### Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
